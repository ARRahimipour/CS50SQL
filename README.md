## What is it?

This is CS50â€™s introduction to databases using a language called SQL. Learn how to create, read, update, and delete data with relational databases, which store data in rows and columns. Learn how to model real-world entities and relationships among them using tables with appropriate types, triggers, and constraints. Learn how to normalize data to eliminate redundancies and reduce potential for errors. Learn how to join tables together using primary and foreign keys. Learn how to automate searches with views and expedite searches with indexes. Learn how to connect SQL with other languages like Python and Java. Course begins with SQLite for portabilityâ€™s sake and ends with introductions to PostgreSQL and MySQL for scalabilityâ€™s sake as well. Assignments inspired by real-world datasets.

> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/honesty/). While these solutions will help you to get through the course without too much effort, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any of my solutions. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery.
